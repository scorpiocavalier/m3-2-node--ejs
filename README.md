# 3.1 Node.Js: Introduction

Welcome to your first Node app!!

This is where things start to get a little more complicated, but a heck of a lot more fun!

## Setup

1. Install the [EJS language support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DigitalBrainstem.javascript-ejs-support) extension for VS Code.
2. Open a terminal window and type `yarn install`
3. Start up the server by typing `yarn dev`

Your node application is now running at https://localhost:8000

### ⚠️ Live Server, NO MORE! ⚠️

**We will no longer be using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.**

When we type `yarn dev` in the terminal, it will spin up a `node` environment that will render our server-side app to the browser.

**If** you find yourself unable to stop trying to run files with it, you could uninstall the extension. We will not need it for the rest of the bootcamp.

## Deeper Dive into this app

### Required dependencies

If you look in the `package.json` file you will see all of the external dependencies, or modules, that we will need for today's workshop.

| package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) | Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node. |
| [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) | nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. |
| [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) | HTTP request logger middleware for node.js |
| [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) | Embedded JavaScript templates. |
| [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) | A lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. |

## EJS Syntax

- `<%` 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
- `<%=` Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
- `<%-` Outputs the unescaped value into the template
- `<%#` Comment tag, no execution, no output
- `%>` Plain ending tag

#### 📝 Note
- When you run `yarn install`, yarn reads the `package.json` and downloads the dependencies in the `node_modules` folder. It will also generate a `yarn.lock` file if it doesn't already exist; if it does exist, it will defer to the version numbers in that file, rather than taking the most recent version available remotely. This is to ensure compatibility and prevent _breaking_ changes in dependencies from, well, breaking our app.
- `ejs` files are basically supercharged `html` files. We can pass in JavaScript values. It allows us to do TONS of cool stuff. 😀
- Use the `styles.css` to add some zing to your exercises
