# 3.1 Node.Js: Introduction

## The Workshop

### Setup

Follow the instructions in the README file that is located at the root of the project.

### Where are the questions?

Questions can be found at the `/question<#>` endpoints in the browser. 

e.g. Question 1 is located at `https://localhost:8000/question1`

### How do I answer the questions?

You will need to use two files to answer most of the questions.

You will write all data-manipulating JS in the `exercisesP<#>.js` file, and when applicable, the HTML output in the `..views/pages/question<#>.ejs` file.

## Note

The solution folder contains solutions but none that can be run. They are technically outside of the app. You can locate the file you are working on and compare with your solution.

## Extra

- Are there any other optimizations that you could make?
- Create a new endpoint. `/bacon` where the visitor can see an inspiring message from you.
- Take a look at the [EJS Docs](https://ejs.co/#docs/)
- If you feel so inclined, add some CSS to create a better looking tutorial. Who knows, the next cohort might use your design. 😉
